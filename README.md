# modakTest
Test for modak


## Considerations

Application is complete in golang, 

In future enhacenments, it would be good to use Clean Arch and code (Uncle Bob Is Happy), Also make uses of Dependency Injection with Fx-Uber to make it run easily.

Pkg like HTTP and GRPC are reusable as they should be.


## Onboard

Please, follow these steps to run app localy to test features and develop.

### How to install

1- Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/joeberth/modakTest.git
```

2- change to app folder
